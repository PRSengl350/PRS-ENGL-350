When I started my senior year of college, I had no idea I would be taking a Digital Humanities course. The writing intensive class I had originally enrolled in was cancelled in August, and I had to scramble to find a new class that worked with my schedule. I went with _Writing for the Digital Humanities_ both because it seemed interesting and because the concept of digitizing humanities disciplines seemed relevant to my aspiring library career. I have learned so much in this course about making humanities content accessible to all, and the skills I gained in blogging, GitHub, and grant writing will help me in my future career.

Having never heard of the Digital Humanities before August, I did not know what to expect. I had pictured the discipline as something along the lines of uploading data from papers or creating blog posts on academic subjects for easier reading. However, I soon learned that the Digital Humanities are all about making knowledge more accessible through interactivity and open-access materials, which appealed to me as an aspiring librarian.

The readings from the first few weeks were especially helpful for me with understanding what the Digital Humanities were. I did find some of the academic papers a bit hard to read, but as someone coming from a completely different field (music composition), I think this was just because of jargon that I did not have the vocabulary to fully understand. The non-journal readings such as website articles and book chapters were much easier for me to comprehend. I found the readings on how to write grants to be very helpful, as I was new to that subject as well. Overall, most of the readings in this course were easy to understand and provided a useful backbone for approaching class assignments.

Most of the assignments in this course were useful for understanding the Digital Humanities. The review blogs in particular were very helpful for me, as I learned how to critically analyze existing projects and what mistakes not to make when creating my own. The grant project itself was one of my favorite assignments in this class, as I could practice writing skills for my future career while also focusing on something I love, Schubertâ€™s _Winterreise_.
I am also glad that the grant project involved creating a resume, as I had never written one designed for a non-music job. Creating the resume in a guided environment made me more confident in my accomplishments, and now I can update it for graduate school and beyond. While I found the weekly Tweets superfluous, I can acknowledge their use in learning concise communication and fostering interaction.

I do think that this class has helped me grow as a writer. Writing Tweets and blogs is very different skillset than writing papers, and this class gave me the chance to practice writing for non-academic audiences. I learned to be concise in my wording while also keeping jargon to a minimum, and my writing will hopefully be more accessible in the future. I also had no experience in writing grants, but I now feel confident in my ability to apply for actual grants someday if I have need to do so.

Thanks to this course, I have gained an understanding and appreciation of what the Digital Humanities are and how they strive to make content more interactive and accessible. I have also become a better non-academic writer and learned how to make my language easier for others to comprehend. I now even have basic GitHub skills that I can use to create projects in the future. Overall, _Writing for the Digital Humanities_ was an excellent course that has helped me gain writing skills that I can use in my future career.
