# About Me

Greetings! My name is Pat S. (pronouns are _she/her_), and I am a senior music composition major at Christopher Newport University (CNU). 

I have been composing music steadily since I was in elementary school, and majoring in music has expanded my horizons in everything from compositional techniques to even what counts as music itself. This has led me to many different musical traditions, and I find the history behind composers and ideological movements fascinating. 

Music itself is a multidimensional experience for me- I have synesthesia, which for me means that I “see” colors whenever I hear music. Composing lets me dive deep into these musical color palates and make my own mark with my sonic brush.

Here are some compositions I’ve written while at CNU:

_A still from_ Hans' Haunted Night


* [**_Hans’ Haunted Night_**](https://youtu.be/X9YBH0A-9pM?t=3052) _(chamber ensemble and slide presentation of art)_ 
  * This is my favorite work that I’ve written so far. The music live-scores a slide presentation of cartoons, drawn myself, that tells the story of a yellow cat, Hans, and his vacation gone wrong. The video links to the premiere at the Fall 2021 CNU Composer’s Forum concert. This was also presented in fixed media format at the 2022 CNU Paideia research conference.
* [**_Sleepless Midnight_**](https://youtu.be/CZymLyegvP4?t=511) _(piano and toy piano)_ 
  * This work was presented at both the 2022 CNU Contemporary Music Festival and the Spring 2022 Composer’s Forum concert. It features several extended piano techniques and includes a section for improvisation using ping-pong balls.
* [**_Midnight Stomp_**](https://youtu.be/YqqlWdUmD90?t=107) _(jazz ensemble)_ 
  * This old-fashioned big-band piece received its premiere by the CNU Jazz Ensemble as part of a live recording event in spring 2022. The name draws on the colors I “hear” from my synesthesia- in this case, dark green, black, and gold, like standing under a streetlight at midnight.



My compositional experience at CNU goes beyond writing for departmental recitals. For the past two years, I have arranged extra parts for the CNU Wind Ensemble for our Family Weekend and Holiday Happening concerts. Additionally, I composed the music for a [**CNU Day promotional video**](https://www.facebook.com/christophernewportuniversity/videos/goooooooood-morning-captains-its-cnu-day/695851071599575/ ), which was then recorded by the Wind Ensemble.

I am not just a composer; I am a performer as well. My primary instrument is the French horn, but I also play the Wagner tuba, trumpet, trombone, and an electronic instrument called the [**LinnStrument**](https://www.rogerlinndesign.com/linnstrument). (Please ask me about my Wagner tuba. I will talk to you about it for hours.)

_Ask me about my Wagner tuba. I dare you._

My favorite group to play in is the Wind Ensemble, where I play the principal French horn part. We tackle a variety of contemporary repertoire, and I enjoy the challenging extended techniques and being able to play works by modern composers like myself.

After graduating, I plan to enroll in a Master of Library and Information Sciences (MLIS) degree program to pursue music librarianship. There’s a lot of overlapping skills in composition and music librarianship, and I know my experience in notation software and digital audio workstations will be an asset to my future career. I love the idea of organizing and preserving music for future generations of listeners.

In all honesty, I had never heard of the digital humanities (DH) before starting this course, ENGL 350. However, I like the idea of using technology to make humanities content more accessible. As a music librarian, I could use DH to take some of the mystery away from concert music via integrating composer information and formal structure into a digital, interactive musical score. This would be far more interesting to readers than a printed program, thus helping bring the concert hall into the digital age.

Outside of music, I enjoy drawing cartoon cats and rabbits in the same world as in my piece Hans’ Haunted Night; maybe I’ll write a children’s book with them someday. True to my librarianship career path, I regularly devour great quantities of books, mostly in the Urban Fantasy genre (Seanan McGuire is my favorite author). I have around **1400 books** in my personal collection, which I have cataloged by multiple fields in an Excel spreadsheet- again, total future librarian. I can also be found spending time with my two cats, Belle and Chloey, who often sabotage my reading time by trying to break into my closet for reasons known only to themselves.

_Belle (tabby) and Chloey (calico). Don't trust those faces, they're up to something._

Senior year of college is both exciting and bittersweet. On one hand, it’s the year of my senior composition recital, a concert composed entirely of my own works. On the other hand, it’s my last year in the Wind Ensemble and the small community that is the music department. All in all, I’m trying to take everything in one day at a time to make the most of my last undergraduate year.
