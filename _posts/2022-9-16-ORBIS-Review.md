#### **Overview**

*ORBIS: The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World* is a map simulating travel costs along common routes in the Roman Empire around 200 CE. Users select a start and end city and choose from eight methods of travel, from civilian on foot to rapid military march. The user chooses the month or season of the projected journey, allowing _ORBIS_ to consider climate conditions when calculating a route. The program then computes the route over land, river, or sea, based on what the user deems their highest priority: fast, cheap, or short. _ORBIS_ then lists that journey’s cost in Roman denarii for transporting a kilogram of wheat (either by donkey or by wagon) or for passage in a carriage. As _ORBIS_ creates an average experience generated from simulations, it best used for calculating longer journeys to incorporate as many data points as possible. With its easy-to-use interface and clear maps, ORBIS aids both new and experienced users in understanding travel conditions and expenses in the Roman Empire.

#### **Data**

The historical texts and studies used to create _ORBIS_ are located under the “Building” tab on the startup screen and are organized by type of travel- sea, road, or river. Each category is then further divided into routes used, time, and expense. Data citations are provided in the text or are hyperlinked in footnotes, which clarify the claims made or direct the user to certain studies to see more. A list of all references used to create _ORBIS_ is found in alphabetical order at the bottom of the page.

While _ORBIS_ shows data transparency by listing and explaining its sources, there are some ways to improve. For example, only a fraction of the works cited at the end of the document are paired with claims and reasoning in the text. If each claim was paired with its source, the user would be better able to evaluate the data themselves. Likewise, very few of the studies cited link to a website or electronic text, putting the onus on the reader to track down the information used. This could easily be fixed by making each reference link to an electronic version of that material.

#### **Technology**

According to the “Geospatial” tab, ORBIS uses a software called D3.js to create the interactive map. Various underlying algorithms help run simulations about the route based on the user’s parameters. While _ORBIS’_ creators did provide a lengthy explanation of the project’s technology, it is challenging for users unfamiliar with mapmaking software to understand. Perhaps a future version of _ORBIS_ could clarify the technical language to it more accessible.

#### **Design and Usability**

Although the technology behind _ORBIS_ is confusing, the main interface is very easy to use. The left-side panel that controls the simulations makes it very clear which parameters are controlled by underlining the selected option in red, and drop-down menus are clearly indicated by boxes with arrows. Also, the map itself has interactive components that let users select cities and routes as well as scroll around the Roman world. An additional panel on the right of the screen contains options to toggle map displays on and off. These interactive panels make _ORBIS_ easy to navigate and let the user refine data.

Unfortunately, _ORBIS’_ interface does have a few design issues. On a tablet, the user cannot zoom in and out on the map with their fingers without moving the page itself around. Also, zooming can lag on both desktop and mobile devices. Additionally, some text at the bottom of the screen is cut off; this can be fixed by allowing the user to scroll the text or by shrinking the font size to make it fit.

For _ORBIS_ learners, a user guide with YouTube tutorials is available under the “Using” tab of the startup screen. Additionally, an interactive tutorial is available by clicking “Tutorials” on the map screen. This tutorial is very helpful, as it explains the purpose of each option with clear language and allows the user to practice inputting information while the tutorial is giving guidance. Unfortunately, this tutorial option is easily overlooked, as it is in the top right corner of the main screen. It would be helpful to have the tutorial option open automatically upon loading so that the user does not have to search for it.

Although it has a well-executed user interface, *ORBIS* does have some issues in its “About” information. Many of the hyperlinks provided lead to sites that no longer exist. Of the active hyperlinks, most do not open in a separate tab, and if the user hits the back button, the site resets to the “Home” tab and the user must navigate back to where they were previously at. This can easily be solved by causing all links to open in a separate tab.
The broken links may be due to a lack of project sustainability: as there is no information or dates provided after 2013, *ORBIS* is likely not active and would need to receive funding to update and address these broken links. 

#### **Conclusion**

While it does have a few design issues, *ORBIS* is a well-designed platform for learning about travel in the Roman Empire. The simulations in *ORBIS* can be applied in many disciplines. It can help economists, for example, by providing data on how traders used money to travel in the ancient world. Military historians can use the soldier travel options in *ORBIS* to gain insights into march times along common routes and associated campaign costs. Even beginning Latin students can use *ORBIS* to add visual context to lessons about Roman political geography. Overall, *ORBIS* makes it easier for anyone to understand travel conditions and expenses in the Roman Empire.
